# Introduction

This is a book about Ansible, an open-source software provisioning tool that is starting to find an audience amongst developers who also do some sysadmin work.

I've written this book to share best practices for working with Ansible.  It complements the official documentation written by the folks at AnsibleWorks.

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is for anyone who wants to start using Ansible, and for anyone already using Ansible who wants to improve their practices and approach.

You will need to be comfortable doing basic Linux administration from the command-line.  Most of the examples are for Ubuntu 13.10.

## What Will You Learn From This Book?

This book will teach you the key skills you need for using Ansible.

* You'll learn the [key concepts](key-concepts.html) behind how Ansible works, and where to find more information about them in the official Ansible documentation.
* You'll learn how to [create your first playbook](first-playbook.html) and how to [organise your Ansible playbooks](organising-your-ansible-files.html).
* You'll learn how to [build an Ansible role](building-roles.html) by following a simple three-point plan.
* You'll learn how to [restart services when your role makes changes](restarting-services.html).
* You'll learn how to [add dependencies to your Ansible roles](adding-dependencies-to-roles.html).
* You'll learn how to [make your Ansible roles repeatable](making-roles-repeatable.html) so that you can safely run them time and time again against the same computer.
* You'll learn how to [debug and troubleshoot roles](debugging-failing-roles.html) when they stop working or aren't working first time around.
* You'll learn how to [support multiple operating systems](multiple-operating-systems.html) from the same, single Ansible repo.
* You'll learn how to [manage the Ansible inventory](managing-the-inventory.html) as you start to use Ansible on more computers.

## Why Am I Qualified To Write This Book?

* I've been using Ansible on a daily basis since November 2012, when I adopted it for building test environments at DataSift.
* I've been managing, and writing software for Linux servers for 20 years.
