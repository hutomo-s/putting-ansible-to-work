# Feedback Most Welcome

## That's All, Folks!

You've reached the end of this e-book.  Now it's time for you to take what you've learned and start using Ansible to provision your computers.

## Tell Me Your Story

Has this book helped you?  I've love to hear how.

Please write to me with your success stories, your horror stories, and your feedback on things that I need to update or additional things that I need to cover for the next edition.

You can reach me at stuart (at) stuartherbert dot com. I look forward to hearing from you.
